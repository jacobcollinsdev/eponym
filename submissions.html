                    <p>Eponym Magazine accepts poetry, art, photography and any other medium which can be presented on the pages of a magazine. If you’re unsure whether we’ll accept the branch of creation which your work falls under, just email us at <a href="mailto:eponymmag@gmail.com">eponymmag@gmail.com</a> to ask.</p>
            
                    <h3 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold mt-5">Who Can Submit?</h3>
                    <p>Any submitters should be between the ages of 15-24. If you turn 25 after the submissions deadline, you are still eligible to be published. As our magazine is about the perspective of the British youth, submitters should have grown up in the UK or have spent significant time there.</p>                    
                    
                    <h3 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold mt-5">How Many Submissions Can I Make?</h3>
                    <p>We do accept multiple submissions from one creator. You can send it all in a single email, just ensure that each piece of art is in a separate and clearly-titled attachment. The maximum number of submissions per creator is 3.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4">Eponym accepts simultaneous submissions, but please make us aware of this fact in the body of your email when you submit. If your work is accepted elsewhere and you wish to publish it there instead, that’s totally fine! Just drop us an email to let us know you’d like to remove your submission to the issue.</p>
        
                    <h3 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold mt-5">Additional Information</h3>
                    <p>What you send to Eponym remains yours. We retain the right to publish your work (unless you withdraw your submission) and feature it on our social media accounts, but your work will always belong to you.</p>

                            <p>To submit to Eponym Magazine, email us an attachment of your work at <a href="mailto:eponymmag@gmail.com">eponymmag@gmail.com</a>, including your name and the title of your work in the subject, and your pronouns in the email body. We welcome third-person bios, but they are not required. If you wish to include one, put it in the body of your email and keep it fairly short (two or three sentences should do!). You can check our previous issues to see how others have written their third-person bios if you’re not sure how to write your own.</p>
        
                            <p class="mt-4">If you feel your work needs explanation, feel free to include a short explanation of your submission in the body of your email.</p>
                
                            <p class="mt-4">If you are submitting a form of writing, please submit your work in size 11 font with no formatting. If you are submitting a poem, it should be no longer than 5 pages. If you’re submitting micro- or flash fiction, it should be around 1000 words at most. </p>
